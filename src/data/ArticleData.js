        exerpt: "I created this guide for those who may be new to hiking in Washington state, or old pros that are looking to take a new friend or a group of out-of-towners on an adventure but aren’t sure of where to start. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it should be a good starting point for those looking for inspiration for their next adventure."

        exerpt: "Women’s kindness is warmth. It is the sun. It is like a fresh breeze coming off the surf of the ocean on a sweltering summer afternoon. It is a plush blanket, stuffed full of the finest down feathers and melts to the touch like butter. It is comfort, and it is also power. "

        exerpt: "Snow covers the trail for most of the way. Starting shortly after the start of the winter route branch, you gain some serious elevation, that is very steep, covered in snow and runs over a river underneath. I experienced some vertigo going up, partly from the steepness and partly from nervousness of not having an ice axe. That being said, an ice axe is a must for this trail now."

        exerpt: "The trail is a gradual incline which is suitable for most hikers, but extremely muddy, and there were at least big five stream crossings, one of which I would not have crossed if I didn’t have poles. If you’re doing this trail waterproof shoes are a must have. "

        exerpt: "Got to the trailhead around 8AM on a Saturday and the parking lot was half full and the trail in was not crowded. By 3PM though, the parking lot was completely full and we passed by a ton of people on the way back there; made me nervous about social distancing."
